The aim of the project is to generate text using generative adversarial
networks (GANs), where both components are recurrent/LSTM neural networks.
The training data set is a collection of internet comments from YouTube,
Twitter and Kaggle also containing a (binary) negative sentiment indicator.
The model output is evaluated using the result of Markov chain trained on
the same data. Absolute quality of the text is evaluated manually against
a test set. Sentiment input integration into LSTM GAN is discussed.
