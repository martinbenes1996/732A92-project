The aim of the project is to generate text using generative adversarial
networks (GANs), where both components are recurrent/LSTM neural networks.
The training data set is a collection of internet comments from YouTube,
Twitter and Kaggle also containing a (binary) negative sentiment indicator.
The model output is evaluated by perplexity using the Markov chain model
trained on the training data related to perplexity of test data. Sentiment
input integration into LSTM GAN is discussed.
